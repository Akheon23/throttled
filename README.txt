Whats New (0.5.1)
1. Added skipto rules for bonjour networks and 10.x.x.x networks. This should fix the remaining LAN issues people have reported.
2. Included sample configuration for Wired.

Whats New (0.5.0)
First I wanted to thank Stefano Ciccarelli for implementing weighted queues and becoming our first major contributor on the project. Without his work, this release would not have been possible. Now, on to the changes:
1. Implemented full weighted queues using WF2Q+.
2. Removed ACK priority and LAN uncapping features in the binary. They are now done in the throttled-startup file via ipfw rules.
3. Now compiles under Leopard.

Whats New (0.4.6) -
1. Updated priority_queue to use deque instead of vector for better memory management.

Whats New (0.4.5) -
1. Updated startup messages for local network throttling and updated the help/usage text.

Whats New (0.4.4) -
1. Compiled as a Universal Binary for PPC, PPC64, and Intel.

Whats New (0.4.3) -
1. Tweaked configuration files so they operate with more firewalls.
2. Changed some ipfw rule syntax to accommodate 10.3.9 users. 

Whats New (0.4.2) -
1. Modified the default config to not prioritize smtp or aim.
2. Included a few sample configs besides the default.
3. Added -v flag for version information.

Whats New (0.4.1) -
1. Fixed StartupItem for OS X.
2. Added divert rules for Ghost Recon.

Whats New (0.4) -
1. UDP support now works. This allows for VOIP and game priority options.
2. Simplified the rule removal code. See the -r flag. (Luigi--)
3. Compiles clean with gcc4 on Mac OS X 10.3-10.4.x, FreeBSD 4.x, and FreeBSD 5.x.
4. Linux support has been removed to clean up the codebase. 
5. The default throttled-startup script now has more rules, mainly for the VOIP and gaming features.

Whats New (0.3.2) -
1. Fixed FreeBSD pthread issues. Now should compile cleanly on 4.x and 5.x. 
2. Fixed a few packet priority bugs (thx Dave).

Whats New (0.3.1) -
1. Added iTunes TTL fix as -T flag.
2. Added default rule for Wired listing ports (port 2000)
